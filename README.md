# aurpkger

`aurpkger` is an AUR helper written in shell script. It uses `apt-get` like
syntax not because I use it, but because it is easier to implement.

## Installation

Currently, `aurpkger` is not on the AUR. I will try to get it there once it
becomes more stable.

Using github, It's pretty easy to get it up and running:

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/Insert-Creative-Name-Here/aurpkger.git
$ cd aurpkger
$ ls
aurpkger
...
```

The 'aurpkger' file is the program here. You can run it with `$ ./aurpkger` when
in that directory *or* you can move it to a folder on `$PATH`
